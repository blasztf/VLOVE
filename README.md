# VLOVE
App helper for VLIVE app.
This app will help you notice if any channel you follow release a video by poping the notification and vibrate the phone.
This app can help you to watch any video on vlive offline by downloading it with V Saver & organize + play it with V Later.
This app can help you to save some post (up to 5 post) on fanboard, so if you ask a question in fanboard you can be notified too with V Board.
And many more (if this app used by many people, hehehehehehehehe).

Upcoming feature:
+ Translate post (any post, not just an idol post) with papago so (hopefully) it can achieve accurate translation.
+ Open a saved post with VLIVE app, not a browser.
+ Play video with VLIVE player, not a native video player (hopefully it can be achieved).
