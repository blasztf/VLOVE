# VLOVE
App helper for VLIVE app.
This app will help you :
+ Alert you if any channel you follow release a video by poping the notification and vibrate the phone.
+ To watch any video on vlive offline by downloading it with V Saver & organize + play it with V Later.
+ To save some post (up to 5 post) on fanboard, so if you ask a question in fanboard you can be notified too with V Board.
+ To translate any post from fanboard (Experimental).

Changelog version 1.1.0:
+ Now, V Saver can save video from ch plus (although it's still experimental, but YAY).

And many more (if this app used by many people, hehehehehehehehe).

Upcoming feature:
- Open a saved post with VLIVE app, not a browser.
- Play video with VLIVE player, not a native video player (hopefully it can be achieved).
